JDBC API

Java Application

DB Server
      To store data permanently 
      
      in file also we are able to store data and we can use the data .
      we can store data in database in table format or in relation.
      we can efficently fetch the data.
      and main issue is security
      java developer wants to store data store permanently 
      
      
      JDBC API
      API 
          is way to interact the one program with another programm.
          here java application is one program and another is database. 
          jdbc api provides predife classes, methods,
          package java.sql  ==> it contains jdbc related content.
          
          
          jdbc to store data parmantley and persistenly
          if i want to transfer data from one application to another application.

           1. Jdbc API(java Database Connectivity  Application programming interface) 
                which provices the way to communicate with one program with another program.
           2.  The main purpose  of JDBC api is to store the Applications data permanently to the database server
                (oracle,mysql,postgre,etc.)
           3.    Data server provides way to organize our data , so that data can be easily and efficiently 
                access,remove or update.
